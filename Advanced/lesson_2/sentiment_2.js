// There are many ways to implement sentiment analysis. Here, we will use two arrays of words. One array contains words that connote a "positive" sentiment, while the other contains words that connote a "negative" sentiment. Given the counts of positive and negative words in our text, we can compute a sentiment score as the difference between the two counts, "positive word count - negative word count." The sentiment of the text is positive if the difference is positive, negative if the difference is negative, and neutral if the difference is 0 (the word counts are equal).

// Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some information about whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

/*
Input: string, representing the text we are analyzing
Output: string noting the number of words for positive/negative sentiment, listing those words, and then the overall sentiment

Explicits:  - sentiment = # of pos words - # of neg words
            - if sentiment is 0, overall sentiment is neutral
Implicits:  - Does case matter? no
            - Does it have to be the exact word? no
            - punctuation looks ignored

DS: arrays

Algorithm:
- Split the text into words -- wordArray,spaces as the separator
- Create a positiveCountObject {'fortune': 2, ...}
- Create a negativeCountObject
- Iterate through the wordArray
    - For the length of the positiveWords array, check if the postivie word includes the word from the wordArray lowercased
        - if the word exists in the positiveCountObject, add 1
        - else set to 1
    - 
        - if the word exists in the negativeCountObject, add 1
        - else set to 1
- Get the values for positiveCountObject and sum --> reduce method
- Get the values for the negativeCountObject and sum --> reduce method
- Subtract the two to get the overallSentiment
- Log the results
    - Number of positive words
    - A list of the positive words --> Get the properties from the positiveCountObject (Object.keys())
        - log each key in a string --> join method 
    - A list of the negative words --> extract from negCountObject --> join
    - Log the overallSentiment
